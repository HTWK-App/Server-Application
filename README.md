The Server-Application is the counterpart to the [Smartphone-App](https://github.com/HTWK-App/Smartphone-App), doing intense computations, caching and much more. It was build with the [Spring-Framework](https://spring.io/), using Jave EE 7 as the main programming language. As a build automation tool, [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is doing the job.
